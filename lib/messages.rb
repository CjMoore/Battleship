    # The first ship you will place is a has two coordinates, the second has three.\n
    # Please enter adjacent coordinates. Next the computer will place its own ships.\n
    # Next you will be asked to enter a coordinate at which you wish to shoot.\n
    # The computer will then take its shot. If there is a hit the board will print\n
    # and H at that location, if there is a miss an M will be printed. The game ends\n
